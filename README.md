# My project

I have customized my google maps APP in to a surfing spots over L.A with a direct link to google navigation system,
The applications of this APP have a realy huge range, from a simple store locator, to a small city locations finder, where u can charge the shopkeepers to put they directions on the app so ppl can finde they more easily.
I Still working on it, so more changes are going to be uploaded.
